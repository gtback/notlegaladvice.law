      <h2 id=what>What do these things mean?</h2>
      <p>Lawyers use these phrases to tell people who aren’t lawyers that they won’t be held professionally responsible for what they’re about to say.</p>
      <p>In other words, these phrases work like <em>disclaimers</em>.  The usual guarantees about lawyer advice don’t apply.</p>
      <h2 id=why>Why do lawyers say these things?</h2>
      <p>Severeal reasons:</p>
      <p id=relationship>When a legal professional <dfn>becomes a client’s lawyer</dfn>, otherwise known as <dfn>creating an attorney-client relationship</dfn>, the lawyer becomes professionally and legally responsible for the advice and service they give to their client.  This usually happens when lawyer and client cosign a written <dfn>engagement letters</dfn>, but a written agreement isn’t required.  An attorney-client relationship can start without one.</p>
      <p id=malpractice>If the lawyer gives particularly bad advice or fails to meet other standards, like competence and responsiveness, their bar association can discipline them for failing to meet standards.  In really serious cases, the client might even be able to sue them for legal malpractice.  Bar discipline and malpractice can even lead to <dfn>disbarment</dfn>, or losing their license to practice law.</p>
      <p id=cost>When hear a phrase like those above, the legal thoughts the lawyer is about to share often come at no cost to you.  They may even be published online for free, for anyone to see.  Since the lawyer isn’t making any money, they don’t want to take the risk that others will misunderstand or misuse what they said, create trouble, and then try to blame the lawyer for giving bad advice.</p>
      <p id=informal>The risk of these misunderstandings is particularly high when a lawyer gives a presentation, speaks on a panel, writes a blog post, publishes via social media, or otherwise shares their thoughts informally, especially off-the-cuff.  Sharing overall impressions, opinions, or new ideas reads and sounds very different than the kind of analysis lawyers typically do for clients when specific problems come up.  It’s often hard for people who aren’t lawyers to tell the difference between lawyer shop talk and legal advice.  Especially when they really want legal advice, and don’t want the trouble or expense of engaging a lawyer professionally.</p>
      <p id=exceptions>What’s more, when lawyers talk informally about law, they often generalize quite a bit.  Just like in life, nearly every rule in law comes with exceptions.  The exceptions are often more imnportant than the rules for specific cases.  But lawyers speaking about the law without a particular client in mind usually focus on the rules, and may not even mention the exceptions, much less the exceptions that matter to everyone who might read or listen.</p>
